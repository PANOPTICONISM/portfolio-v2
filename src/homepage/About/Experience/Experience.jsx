          As a part of this startup, I have been given a chance to spread my
          wings to grow and extend my knowledge. Whilst managing the WordPress
          platform, I re-design a lot of different aspects of the company's
          visual identity while continously developing the new platform.

          In this internship, I had the opportunity to join the design team,
          where I used my researcher and designer skills on different features
          to improve the web platform experience.

          As the designer and developer, I saw every project from start to end
          by working alongside with my clients to bring their aspirations to
          life.
