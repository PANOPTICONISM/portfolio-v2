            Welcome! Let me share a bit about myself: my name is Maria, born and
            raised in Portugal, but currently residing in Copenhagen, Denmark.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spend all of my free time designing and coding new projects, and
            on my down time I play a lot of video-games, listen to music and
            play sports on occasion.
          </p>

        {/* <Experience /> */}
