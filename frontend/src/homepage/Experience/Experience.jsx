            From a ten weeks internship to a part-time job, I have continued to
            grow as a developer in the IT team, from front-end tasks based in
            React and Angular, to solving back-end tasks as well as been fully
            involved in discussions that aimed to improve how we work as a team,
            to how we deal with incoming requests from our partners.

          <p>
            As a part of this startup, I have been given a chance work with a
            great team and grow my knowledge. Whilst managing the marketing
            website, I have designed and developed a newer version with the
            customer experience at the center, while digging my heel in a
            variety of parts to improve the workflow for all of those involved
            in the process.

            In this internship, I had the opportunity to join the design team,
